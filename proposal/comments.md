Bill Howe:

- Good that we clearly pick "building things" over "doing research
  together"â€”line can be hard to walk.
- Useful to have liason in the studio two days per week.  Also shows
  necessary commitment.
- Companies with money to spend may be interested in recruiting one of
  the volunteers after a project is over.
