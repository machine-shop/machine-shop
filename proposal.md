# The BIDS Machine Shop

## Motivation

As more scientific fields move to intersect with computation, a need
arises for software tools that can bridge the gap between the matter
under investigation and computational principles / software
engineering.  Many scientists are specialists trained in their
respective domains, and thus finding contributors with the necessary
practical experience to implement computational tools, be it for
statistical analysis, data wrangling, machine learning, visualization
or data management, can be difficult.

The aim of the BIDS Machine Shop will be to serve the scientific
community on Berkeley campus by providing human resources to close
this gap.

## Structure

A lab (or scientist) brings a software request coupled with a domain
problem to the Machine Shop.  Requests should envision the development
of a Minimal Viable Product of a software tool that fills a specified
niche, with an estimated development time of one to three months.

The Machine Shop reviews proposals and allocates resources as
available to develop a proof-of-concept tool.  The development takes
place in collaboration with one or more representatives from the lab
(perhaps graduate students under the principle investigator) who are
to act as liason and collaborators, available to the team for
domain-specific questions.

The team develops a prototype through continous feedback from and
interaction with the liason, which is eventually released under a
permissive open source license.

Optionally, the team / lab also writes a short report on the tool and
publishes it on an open access platform such as Arxiv.

## Funding and growth

Initially, the team members will consist of a permanent BIDS member
(myself) and volunteer fellows, as well as recruited undergraduates.
Once the effort has a proven track record, funding can be obtained for

- further development of successful prototypes,
- accepting students into the programme as a data scientist / software
  developer incubator and/or
- growing the size of the development team.

## Engagement with BIDS

New fellows that become parts of BIDS may be interested in joining
this effort in order to

- grow their own software development experience,
- contribute to the scientific community,
- build out their network of contacts, and/or
- publish their multi-disciplinary work.

## Conclusion

The time cost of developing high quality scientific code can be high
and detrimental to the very science it aims to serve.  Yet, nowadays,
higher expectations are leveraged against research codes, and
reproducibility is demanded of rigorous research.  I envision a small,
flexible, low-cost team that will address this issue by providing
scientists with the computational tools needed to move their research
forward as effectively as possible, allowing them to focus on their
primary task.
