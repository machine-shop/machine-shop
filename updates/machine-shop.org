    - P: Hough peak detector
      - Applied algorithm to sunglass image, but circle detector never finishes

    - P: Generalize the Hough transform peak detector
      - Read through ellipse / circle papers
      - Output of ellipse / circle / line are quite different, need to
        figure out what parts of the peak detector can be re-used

      - Done with ellipse peak detector
      - (Then circle, then general detector)
    - ?:
      - No feedback yet on #2002

    - P:
      - Finished implementing replace; testing replace_15.py, doproduction_3

      - Going to finish normTheStats_13.py, and 2 other functions. We
        are planning to meet on Sunday morning and have a coding
        sprint until afternoon.
    - ?:
      - I spent quite a bit of time figuring out how to export intermediate
        matrixes from Matlab and import them to numpy for testing; I'm
        wondering if there is a better way for this process. (S: answered)
      - I have also encountered cases that small differences between two
        numpy arrays return a false value when comparing. Is using
        np.isclose or np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal the correct
        approach to resolve such issue? (S: answered)

    - P: worked on getting caught up with Ananth and Ace (nice work
      you guys!), reviewed GIT workflow, revised goals for development
      of error checking codes, developed a "theory-sheet" describing
      the "mathematical-backbone" of the information theory
      statistics, and scheduled a "sprint" and "codeathon" with Ace
      and Ananth for the coming week.
    - N: code uniform bin edges and script for calculating conditional,
      joint, and marginal entropies, start list, in "issues", of
      desired code improvements, survive the "codeathon" to enhance
      understanding of core algorithms
